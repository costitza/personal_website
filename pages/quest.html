            <h2>introduction</h2>
            <p>
            <strong>Quest</strong> is a multifunctional rescue robot designed to operate efficiently in critical and hard-to-reach environments. 
            Developed by <strong>Raul-Costin Ababei</strong> and <strong>Alexandru-Lucian Motoașcă</strong> at 
            <em>Colegiul Național de Informatică “Grigore Moisil” Brașov</em>, this project combines ground mobility and aerial versatility 
            to assist in emergency missions such as locating missing persons, exploring caves, or supporting firefighting operations.

        <section class="section">
            <h2>motivation</h2>
            <p>
            The idea behind Quest emerged from a real need for innovative tools that can save lives in extreme situations. 
            Traditional rescue missions are often delayed or limited by terrain and safety constraints. 
            Quest was imagined as a machine capable of overcoming these obstacles — a robot that can both 
            <strong>drive on four wheels</strong> and <strong>take flight</strong>, reaching areas where human access is dangerous or impossible.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>capabilities & usefulness</h2>
            <p>Quest operates in two main modes:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Rover mode:</strong> Moves on wheels, consumes minimal energy, and can transport small medical kits such as bandages or food to people trapped in hazardous zones.</li>
            <li><strong>Drone mode:</strong> With a simple command, Quest extends its arms and transforms into a quadcopter, capable of scanning large areas from above. It can detect heat sources, locate survivors, and transmit live video data to emergency teams.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Equipped with a <strong>high-resolution camera</strong>, <strong>AI-based object detection</strong>, and 
            <strong>real-time image transmission</strong>, Quest provides an intelligent and adaptive solution for both monitoring and active intervention.

            <h2>design and structure</h2>
            <p>
            Mechanically, Quest is an elegant fusion of robotics and aeronautics. 
            Its frame is 3D-printed using <strong>PETG</strong> and <strong>PETG-CF</strong>, ensuring strength without excessive weight.
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Each leg integrates two servo motors for articulation.</li>
            <li>Each wheel assembly includes a DC motor and a brushless motor with propeller for flight.</li>
            <li>Magnetic supports reduce strain on servos and stabilize the robot even when unpowered.</li>
            <li>The centrally placed battery ensures balance and easy replacement.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>electronics and control</h2>
            <p>The electronic system integrates multiple components for stability and intelligence:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Raspberry Pi 4B</strong> – main controller managing overall coordination and communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Arduino Mega</strong> – controls servo and DC motors.</li>
            <li><strong>Pixhawk 2.4.8</strong> – handles flight stabilization and telemetry.</li>
            <li><strong>OAK-D Lite</strong> – provides real-time vision with object detection using YOLOv8 nano.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            The power system uses multiple voltage converters to safely supply all modules, while serial and UART communication links 
            keep sensors, motors, and processors synchronized.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
            Quest represents a fusion of creativity, engineering, and purpose — a machine built not just to demonstrate technical ability, 
            but to <strong>save lives</strong>. Through the combination of robotics, AI, and intelligent control systems, 
            Quest pushes the boundaries of what small-scale autonomous systems can achieve in emergency response.
